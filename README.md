# Cisco FTD to Splunk Visualization

An interactive 3D visualization demonstrating the data flow from endpoints through Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) devices to Splunk for security analytics.

## ‚ú® Features

- Interactive 3D visualization built with Three.js
- Animated data packets showing the flow of information
- Detailed architecture showing endpoints, FTD, FMC, and Splunk
- Full camera controls (rotation, zoom)
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- React.js
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- Next.js for easy development and deployment
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## üèóÔ∏è Setup and Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/josehelps/cisco-ftd-visualization.git
cd cisco-ftd-visualization
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the visualization.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## üì± Embedding

To embed this visualization in your blog or website, use an iframe:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://josehelps.github.io/cisco-ftd-visualization" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600px" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

## üåü How It Works

The visualization shows:

1. **Endpoints** (gray boxes) generating network traffic
2. **Cisco FTD** (red box) processing and filtering the traffic
3. **Firewall Management Center (FMC)** (blue box) managing the FTD configuration
4. **Splunk** (green box) ingesting logs and providing security analytics
5. **Data Packets** (yellow spheres) flowing through the system

Each component represents a key part of the security architecture:

- **Endpoints** represent user workstations generating network traffic
- **Cisco FTD** provides next-generation firewall capabilities
- **FMC** centrally manages firewall policies and configurations
- **Splunk** analyzes security data to detect and respond to threats
